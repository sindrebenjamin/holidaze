Datepicker issue, have to tap extra time on touch devices, opened issue about it: https://github.com/onesine/react-tailwindcss-datepicker/issues/254

Bug hvor infinite scroll kan henge seg opp.

A little akward when testing in dev tools on different screen resolutions, have to reload in order to see the datepicker adjust properly.
